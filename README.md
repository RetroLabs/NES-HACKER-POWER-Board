# NES-HACKER-POWER-Board
This project will be an archive of code written for the NES HACKER POWER board. The board is an ESP32 placed in the middle between the NES and NES Controller. This will allow for programmers to send button presses to the NES from the ESP32, reroute botton presses, test new controllers and control things other than the NES. 

To Do List
- Normal play, pass button presses through to NES
- Swap A/B buttons
- ESP-32 send pre programmed button presses to NES
- NES button presses to parallel output
- Display button presses on serial monitor with time stamp 
- Recieve button presses via Bluetooth
- Recieve button presses via WiFi
- More to come
